# Typing-Game
Created a typing game through HTML. The user just has to type into the box and it automatically shows their score right after they finish the sentence 
"I am the fastest typer in the world." There's also a leaderboard to show who got the highest typing speed in one run, also giving the user the ability 
to put down their name on the leaderboard.
